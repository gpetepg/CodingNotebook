**Give an example of various types of graphs (Weighted Undirected, Unweighted Directed, Unweighted Undirected, etc.)**
**What makes a graph a simple graph? What attributes would make it not simple?**
**What is the maximum number of edges in a directed simple graph? Undirected simple graph? Answer should be in terms of N**
**Describe the levels of connectivity a graph can have (strongly connected, weakly connected).**
**What are cycles?**
**What are some naive ways we can store and traverse graphs? Be able to discuss time/space complexity of these approaches, and what issues we may face.**
